# Model cards with vetiver for transparent, responsible reporting

**Julia Silge | Posit PBC | 29 Jan 2025**

Good documentation helps us make sense of software, know when and how to use it, and understand its purpose. The same can be true of documentation or reporting for a deployed model, but it can be hard to know where to start. The paper [“Model Cards for Model Reporting” (Mitchell et al. 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596) provides a suggested framework for organizing and presenting the essential facts about a deployed machine learning model, and the vetiver packages for both R and Python provide templates for getting started with your own model card. In this workflow demo, learn how to get started with your first model card, how a model card fits in with model monitoring, and how to use Posit Team to author and publish your model card.
